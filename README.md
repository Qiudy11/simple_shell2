A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

The Simple shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
